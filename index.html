         <u>The Origin</u>
      </b>
   </h3>
   <p> Fried rice first developed during the Sui Dynasty in China and as such all fried rice dishes can trace their
      origins to
      Chinese fried rice. Many varieties of fried rice have their own specific list of ingredients. In Greater China,
      common varieties include Yangzhou fried rice and Hokkien fried rice. Japanese chāhan is considered a Japanese
      Chinese dish, having derived from Chinese fried rice dishes. In Southeast Asia, similarly constructed Indonesian,
      Malaysian, and Singaporean nasi goreng and Thai khao phat are popular dishes.
      Fried rice is a common street food in Asia. In some Asian countries, small restaurants, street vendors and
      traveling
      hawkers specialize in serving fried rice. In Indonesian cities it is common to find fried rice street hawkers
      moving
      through the streets with their food cart and stationing it in busy streets or residential areas.

         <li>The Tomato Sauce</li>
         <ol type="a">
            <li>Add the boiled rice to the stock in a medium pot and cook on medium heat until the water is dried up.
            </li>
            <li>Preheat the oil in a pan on medium to high heat, throw in the onions, and fry for a minute or two; add
               the
               scallions, mixed vegetables, thyme, curry powder, salt, and stock Cube.</li>
            <li>Throw in the beef liver and rice — Stir-fry for about 3 to 5 minutes on high heat.</li>
            <li>Take it off the heat and serve.</li>
         </ol>
         <li>Notes</li>
         <ol type="a">
            You need to increase the heat and stir continuously to get that nice coveted crisp during frying.
            <li>The white rice should be cooked tender but still firm to bite (like you cook your pasta al-dente).
               Overcooking
               the rice will result in mushy fried rice.</li>
            <li>Fried rice is best enjoyed when the Veggies remain crunchy, so don’t overcook your veggies.</li>

   <p>The added beef liver gives the fried Rice a very nice rich but subtle taste, and this is why it is one of the
      most
      popular choices in Nigeria. Though you can also use Shrimp or any protein you’d like. If you would love to make
      vegan
      fried rice, you can omit the Beef liver or Shrimps entirely!</p>
